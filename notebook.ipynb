    "- The Earth and the Moon are 10 times larger than their actual size.\n",
    "- The Sun is made 1000 times smaller than its real size.\n",
    "- Drawing the Sun to scale would make it immensely larger than the Earth, making the Earth nearly invisible and the Moon completely out of sight.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Initial Setup**: The code begins with `%matplotlib widget` for interactive plotting in Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to zoom and pan the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Library Imports**: Essential libraries are imported for mathematical operations (`numpy`), plotting (`matplotlib.pyplot` and `matplotlib.animation`), and astrodynamics computations (`poliastro` and `astropy`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orbit Definition**: The Moon's orbit around Earth is defined using classical orbital elements such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and others, with `Time.now()` setting the current time as the epoch for the simulation. Note: There's a likely typo with `a_moon = 384.4 * u.km`, which should be `384,400 * u.km` to accurately represent the Moon's semi-major axis distance from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plotting Setup**: A matplotlib figure is created, and axes are set with limits to visualize the Moon's orbit. The Earth and Sun are placed within this space, with the Sun on the left and Earth on the right edge of the plot. The distances and sizes are symbolic and not to scale, especially for the Sun and the orbital path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sun and Earth Representation**: The Sun and Earth are added to the plot as colored circles, with the Sun positioned statically and Earth placed at a predefined distance from the plot's edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moon Initialization**: A placeholder for the Moon is initialized and added to the plot. Its position relative to Earth is updated in the animation to simulate the orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Animation Function**: The `animate` function updates the Moon's position around Earth, simulating an orbit. This function uses the `poliastro` library to calculate the Moon's new position for each frame of the animation, based on the progression of time by hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating and Displaying the Animation**: The `FuncAnimation` function from `matplotlib.animation` is used to compile and run the animation over a specified number of frames, showing the Moon's orbit around Earth. The animation speed and length are controlled by the `frames` and `interval` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Axis Labels**: Labels are added to the x and y axes to denote distances in kilometers, providing context for the simulation's spatial dimensions.\n",
